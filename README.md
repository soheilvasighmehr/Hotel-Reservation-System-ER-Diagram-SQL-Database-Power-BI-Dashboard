# Hotel Reservation System: ER Diagram, SQL Database and Power BI Dashboard
January 2022

In this project, we explored the vital role of databases in the hotel industry, specifically focusing on the reservation process. The hotel industry benefits significantly from efficient data management systems, enhancing the speed and accuracy of processing reservations, managing guest information, and tracking payment details. During the first phase of the project, we designed a database schema with nine key entities, such as guest, reservation, payment, and room, with unique attributes and primary keys to ensure data integrity. Relationships between entities were mapped using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), accounting for various cardinalities like one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. We then implemented these database tables in SQL Server, populating them with relevant data, and used SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. Queries ranged from filtering payment types and calculating revenues to retrieving detailed guest and reservation information through table joins.

In the second phase, we built a dashboard in Power BI to visualize the data captured in phase one. By leveraging the various entities such as guests, reservations, and payments, as well as other hotel areas like rooms, staff, and amenities (e.g., cafes, restaurants, gyms, and pools), the dashboard offers a comprehensive visual representation of key metrics. This visualization enhances the understanding of the hotelâ€™s current status and helps in decision-making and resource allocation, contributing to the improvement and development of different sectors within the hotel. The dashboard highlights critical aspects such as guest demographics, reservation trends, revenue from different sources, and room occupancy rates, providing actionable insights for efficient management.
